resume
======

This is both my personal resume and an example of a Computer Science student's
technical resume. 

You are welcome to use my resume as a template for creating your own resume in
LaTeX. See my advice at http://lug.oregonstate.edu/blog/resume/ for other
technical resume tips. 

To use my resume as a template for your own, either fork this repository (that
"fork" button in the upper right) or simply take a copy of the resume.tex
file. 

To generate and view the PDF, I run ``pdflatex resume.tex && evince
resume.pdf``. You can also use the included Makefile if you prefer.
